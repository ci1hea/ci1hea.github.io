</div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>With a changing climate, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are likely to increase, posing a threat to infrastructure systems’ resilience. The response of infrastructure systems to localised failures depends on whether assets are affected randomly, in a targeted strategic way, or any way in between. More than that, infrastructure decisions today, including new routes or improvements to existing assets, will underpin the behaviour of the systems over the next century. It is important to separate and analyse the case of climate-based disruptions and how they affect systems’ resilience. This paper presents a probabilistic resilience assessment framework where failure scenarios and network disruptions are generated using weather propdf data from climate prediction models with component-level fragility functions. A case study is then carried out to quantify the resilience of Great Britain’s railway passenger transport system to high-temperature-related track buckling under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) climate change scenario. A 95-year horizon on the resilience of the railway system is drawn. The results also reveal the non-linear responses of the railway system to the increasing temperature and show that models considering random asset failures overestimate the system’s resilience.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PiRS</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_regional_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Regional Economic Resilience, Trophic Characteristics, and Ecological Analogies</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NMUsstMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Giuliano Punzo</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Papers in Regional Science</em>, Dec 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20and%20Punzo%20-%202023%20-%20Regional%20economic%20resilience,%20trophic%20characterist.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1111/pirs.12766"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1111/pirs.12766" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Works on regional resilience have at times borrowed from the engineering and ecological framing of system resilience.

Meanwhile, unprecedented urbanization in the Global South is set to put significant demand on the resources required to ensure adequate standards of living in new and existing urban areas. This is particularly important within India, however no study has yet explored material stocks within cities in India or within master planned urban areas designed to accommodate urbanization and a high standard of living. The present study begins to fill these gaps and aims to investigate patterns of built environment material stock accumulation in Chandigarh, an exceptionally quickly developed city master planned to ensure universally high standards of living through a unique urban form. We adopt a bottom-up approach to quantify the residential building and road material stocks at the city and sub-city scale. The results reveal that the master plan, while enabling high standards of living, has resulted in a relative accumulation of road to building stock that is significantly larger than in other cities. This is shown to be environmentally detrimental as future urban development is limited and promotes demolition of existing stocks, whose composition severely limits their potential as secondary resources. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to support the integration of material stock assessments into urban planning and development to ensure resource efficient provisioning of key services.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">BAE</abbr></div> <div id="ward_estimating_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Estimating Energy Consumption of Residential Buildings at Scale with Drive-by Image Capture</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SU1ik_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wil O.

In the UK, housing contributes to over 30% of the national energy consumption, and a massive rollout of retrofit is needed to meet government targets for net zero by 2050. This paper introduces a modular framework for quantifying building features using drive-by image capture and utilising them to estimate energy consumption. The framework is demonstrated on a case study of houses in a UK neighbourhood, showing that it can perform comparatively with gold standard datasets. The paper reflects on the modularity of the proposed framework, potential extensions and applications, and highlights the need for robust data collection in the pursuit of efficient, large-scale interventions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ERL</abbr></div> <div id="tan_towards_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards an Automated Workflow for Large-Scale Housing Retrofit</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=lYOLbNkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ling Min Tan</a>, Hadi Arbabi, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SU1ik_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wil Ward</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=fq-_Sv0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xinyi Li</a>, Danielle Densley Tingley, Ahsan Khan, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, Mar 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acd797" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Tan%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Towards%20an%20automated%20workflow%20for%20large-scale%20hous.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1088/1748-9326/acd797"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1088/1748-9326/acd797" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">STOTEN</abbr></div> <div id="punzo_intrinsic_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Intrinsic Cybernetics of Large Complex Systems and How Droughts Turn into Floods</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NMUsstMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Giuliano Punzo</a>, and Hadi Arbabi</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Science of The Total Environment</em>, Mar 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722070796" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Punzo%20and%20Arbabi%20-%202022%20-%20The%20intrinsic%20cybernetics%20of%20large%20complex%20systems.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159979"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159979" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The cyber-physical nature of engineering systems requires the smooth integration of decision making across soft and hard infrastructure. This need is common to any systems where decision making considers multiple complex systems such as the climate, the natural and built environment, and the dynamics of large organisations. As an example, in the Anthropocene, acute droughts and floods cannot only be imputed to more extreme variations of the climate patterns, but also to the alteration of the habitable environment and of the resources that support it, hence to their governance and management. In this discussion paper we present arguments about the extent to which the natural environment is modified to support urbanisation. We expose the cyber-physical nature of large infrastructure systems taking as an example the events of the 2011 Brisbane flood and the operations of the damming system of the river Brisbane. Using literature resources and data, we show how flood defence devices had to provide for a population of almost 2 million people, while being engineered when the population was less than one million, with increase in water withdrawal mainly due to residential utilities. We show how the cyber-physical aspects of the problem materialised in moth-long delays in the governance and management structure and made the flood event transcend the boundary of a purely climatic or engineering incident. Looking beyond the Brisbane example, our conclusions point at overcoming the discontinuity between operation, management and political layers when operating on cyber-physical systems such as freshwater networks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">MDPI</abbr></div> <div id="dai_scalable_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Scalable Residential Building Geometry Characterisation Using Vehicle-Mounted Camera System</div> <div class="author"> Menglin Dai, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SU1ik_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wil O.

In addition, residential buildings that were built with outdated standards usually face difficulty meeting current energy performance standards. The situation is especially common in Europe, as 35% of buildings were built over fifty years ago. Building retrofitting techniques provide a choice to improve building energy efficiency while maintaining the usable main structures, as opposed to demolition. The retrofit assessment requires the building stock information, including energy demand and material compositions. Therefore, understanding the building stock at scale becomes a critical demand. A significant piece of information is the building geometry, which is essential in building energy modelling and stock analysis. In this investigation, an approach has been developed to automatically measure building dimensions from remote sensing data. The approach is built on a combination of unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including K-means++, DBSCAN and RANSAC. This work is also the first attempt at using a vehicle-mounted data-capturing system to collect data as the input to characterise building geometry. The developed approach is tested on an automatically built and labelled point cloud model dataset of residential buildings and shows capability in acquiring comprehensive geometry information while keeping a high level of accuracy when processing an intact model.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">RSER</abbr></div> <div id="li_net_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Net Zero by 2050: Investigating Carbon-Budget Compliant Retrofit Measures for the English Housing Stock</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=fq-_Sv0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xinyi Li</a>, Hadi Arbabi, George Bennett, Tadj Oreszczyn, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5FTW5ocAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Danielle Densley Tingley</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</em>, Mar 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032122002945" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Li%20et%20al.%20-%202022%20-%20Net%20zero%20by%202050%20Investigating%20carbon-budget%20comp.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1016/j.rser.2022.112384"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1016/j.rser.2022.112384" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The UK has enacted one of the most ambitious carbon reduction targets striving for net zero emissions by 2050. A major challenge to achieving this is decarbonizing heating demand with almost 25 m homes in need of retrofit. This paper explores a range of retrofit interventions to the English residential stock. These are deployed immediately in 2021 to investigate the maximum carbon reduction that could be achieved. The impact of these interventions on embodied and operational carbon emissions is estimated from 2021 to 2050. The resulting emissions are compared to estimated national carbon budgets, in order to ascertain, if, and with what combination of retrofit measures, the English housing stock can stay within carbon budgets. The results show that mass deployment of air source or ground source heat pumps can reliably achieve combined embodied and operational emissions within national carbon budgets by 2050. The careful selection of insulation materials is key in bringing down the embodied emissions, particularly to meet stricter carbon budgets. The identified scale and pace of deployment thus needed to stay within carbon budgets is likely to pose enormous practical challenges. To overcome these challenges, we argue for (a) urgently increasing both heat pump deployment, and renewable generation targets beyond existing pledges, (b) increasing social awareness of residential retrofit benefits, and (c) providing more attractive financing options to incentivise and facilitate retrofit uptake.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JIE</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_scalable_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Scalable Data Collection, Characterization, and Accounting Framework for Urban Material Stocks</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=00i5YJMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Maud Lanau</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=fq-_Sv0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xinyi Li</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tza0HvwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gregory Meyers</a>, Menglin Dai, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5FTW5ocAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Danielle Densley Tingley</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Industrial Ecology</em>, Mar 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jiec.13198" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20et%20al.%20-%202022%20-%20A%20scalable%20data%20collection,%20characterization,%20and.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1111/jiec.13198"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1111/jiec.13198" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Building stocks represent an extensive reservoir of secondary resources. However, common bottom-up characterization of these, often based on archetypal classification of buildings and their corresponding material intensity, are still not suitable to adequately inform circular economic strategies. Indeed, these approaches typically result in a loss of building-specific details, and a building stock characterization in terms of material mass, for example, glass, rather than component, for example, window. To deliver this higher resolution of details, a scalable approach to urban stock characterization, that enables a bottom-up estimation of building stocks at the building component level, is needed. In this paper, we present a framework to automate the characterization of urban stock. By using and combining a mobile-sensing approach with computer vision, urban stocks can be captured as 3D surface maps allowing the identification and semantic classification of stock objects, components, and materials. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through a case study of a neighborhood in Sheffield, UK, by using a prototype workflow comprising a custom-made mobile-sensing platform and an existing suite of neural network models to calculate an estimate count of buildings external doors and windows. The prototype implementation of the framework achieves comparable total and building-level component counts with those achieved through manual human counts. Such automated estimation of components enables an understanding of opportunities across the circular economic hierarchies and informs stakeholders across the supply chain to better prepare for the implementation of circular strategies including building refurbishments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">MDPI</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_comment_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Comment on Bettignies et al.

Bettignies et al. suggest that based on their findings, the urban energy-use drivers are in fact scale-dependent, and that their results reveal a substantial heterogeneity across and within cities. They reference this as why more consideration needs to be paid to local factors when devising urban policy.

This study identifies the hotspots of imports in cities to redirect resources to where they are most needed, based on the system overall resource effectiveness to maximise the use of all resources available. This paper develops a taxonomy of resource-use behaviour based on the clustering patterns of resource utilisation and conversion across interconnected urban systems. We find high tendencies of consumer-like behaviour in a multi-city system because tertiary sectors are concentrated in urban areas while the producing sectors are located outside and hence, results in high utilisation but low output. The clustering taxonomy emphasises that the absence of producers in the system causes cities to rely on the imported resources for growth. Cities can be resource-effective by having a more diversified industrial structure to extend the pathways of resource flows, closing the circularity gap between the suppliers and consumers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">RSOS</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_use_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On the Use of Random Graphs in Analysing Resource Utilization in Urban Systems</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NMUsstMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Giuliano Punzo</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tza0HvwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gregory Meyers</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=lYOLbNkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ling Min Tan</a>, Qianqian Li, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5FTW5ocAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Danielle Densley Tingley</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>, Mar 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.200087" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20On%20the%20use%20of%20random%20graphs%20in%20analysing%20resource.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1098/rsos.200087"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1098/rsos.200087" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Urban resource models increasingly rely on implicit network formulations. Resource consumption behaviours documented in the existing empirical studies are ultimately by-products of the network abstractions underlying these models. Here, we present an analytical formulation and examination of a generic demand-driven network model that accounts for the effectiveness of resource utilization and its implications for policy levers in addressing resource management in cities. We establish simple limiting boundaries to systems’ resource effectiveness. These limits are found not to be a function of system size and to be simply determined by the system’s average ability to maintain resource quality through its transformation processes. We also show that resource utilization in itself does not enjoy considerable size efficiencies with larger and more diverse systems only offering increased chances of finding matching demand and supply between existing sectors in the system.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JRSS A</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_productivity_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Productivity, Infrastructure and Urban Density—an Allometric Comparison of Three European City Regions Across Scales</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a>, and <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/e/pmc79.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Philip McCann</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society)</em>, Mar 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12490" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20Productivity,%20infrastructure%20and%20urban%20density%E2%80%94an.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1111/rssa.12490"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1111/rssa.12490" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Agglomeration-based arguments citing Dutch and German city regions have been a primary driver in advocating intercity transport strategies in the north of England.We adopt an allometric urban model investigating the applicability and transferability of these transport-led agglomerative strategies promoted to address England’s regional economic underperformance.

The question is, how much of the resource available in cities is effectively utilized? In response, this paper develops an ecological-thermodynamic approach to assess the ability of a system to make full use of the resources available and reduce the demand for new resources. In this work, open system network effectiveness analysis is introduced as a novel assessment method to investigate the cities’ producer and consumer behaviors by studying the resource flow connections and the interactions between the socio-economic sectors. Investigation on the urban flows network evaluates the ability of the system to utilize the resource imported through the effectiveness of utilization indicator and the ability to convert the resource imported to useful products through the effectiveness of conversion indicator. The effectiveness indicators, utilization and conversion, represent the consumption and production characteristics of the system respectively. This is tested through a case study conducted for Singapore city over the time period 2005–2014. The effectiveness results show that the city, on average, has utilized 45% of the maximum extractable usefulness from the resources imported throughout the years, with the lowest effectiveness, 39%, and the highest effectiveness, 50%, in the years 2007 and 2014 respectively. The trajectory of effectiveness results throughout the years suggests a trade-off relationship between the producers and consumers to balance the production and consumption of resources in the city.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">RCR</abbr></div> <div id="tan_ecological_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ecological Network Analysis on Intra-City Metabolism of Functional Urban Areas in England and Wales</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=lYOLbNkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ling Min Tan</a>, Hadi Arbabi, Qianqian Li, Yulan Sheng, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5FTW5ocAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Danielle Densley Tingley</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a>, and Daniel Coca</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Resources, Conservation and Recycling</em>, Mar 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344918302301" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Tan%20et%20al.%20-%202018%20-%20Ecological%20network%20analysis%20on%20intra-city%20metaboli.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.06.010"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.06.010" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The UK has one of the world’s most urbanised societies where nearly 83% of the total population lives in cities. The continuing population growth could lead to increases in environmental pollutions and congestion within cities. The framework of urban metabolism uses an analogy between cities and ecosystems to study the metabolic processes within complex urban systems akin to natural biological systems. It remains as a challenge to fully understand the complicated distribution of resource flows within an urban network. In this paper, Ecological Network Analysis was applied to study the intra-city flows between economic sectors in 35 functional urban areas in order to investigate their respective metabolic relationships. The intra-city flows network of each area was also supplemented with the geographical distance between the workplace zones to study the impacts of spatial distribution on the density of resource flows. The metabolic systems were dominated by 64% of exploitative relationships with an average mutualism index of 0.93 and synergism index of 3.56 across all 35 areas. The consumption-control and production-dependency relationships revealed the hierarchical orders among the sectors resembling the pyramidal structure of an urban ecosystem. Network community classification emphasized the importance of inter-relationship within the organisation of each community class. The producer-type and consumer-type communities showed the tendencies of those sectors to cluster based on their respective hierarchical roles in the ecosystem.

This study explores the patterns of energy consumption in England and Wales by investigating consumption behavior within domestic and transport sectors as a function of city characteristics, such as population, density, and density distribution for 346 Local Authority Units (LAU). Patterns observed linking energetic behavior of these LAUs to their respective population and area characteristics highlight some distinctly contrasting consumption behaviors within urban and rural zones. This provides an overview of the correlation between urban/rural status, population, and energy consumption and highlights points of interest for further research and policy intervention. The findings show that energy consumption across cities follows common power law scaling increasing sub-linearly with their population regardless of their urban/rural classification. However, when considering per capita and sector specific consumptions, decreasing per capita consumption patterns are observed for growing population densities within more uniformly populated urban LAUs. This is while rural and sparsely populated LAUs exhibit sharply different patterns for gas, electricity, and transport per capita consumption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">preprints</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">SSRN</abbr></div> <div id="sheng_building_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Building Features Driving City-Scale Residential Energy Consumption: A Multimodal Approach</div> <div class="author"> Yulan Sheng, Hadi Arbabi, Wil OC Ward, Mauricio Álvarez, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> Oct 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4254645" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Sheng%20et%20al.%20-%202022%20-%20Building%20Features%20Driving%20City-Scale%20Residential%20E.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.2139/ssrn.4254645"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.2139/ssrn.4254645" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The important role of buildings in tackling climate change has been globally recognised. To avoid unnecessary costs and time wasted, it is important to understand the conditions and energy usage for existing housing stock to identify the most important features affecting housing energy consumption and to guide the relevant retrofit measures. Existing data-driven and statistical studies that use machine learning for energy consumption usually develop models using all available variables relevant to building, which can be redundant. This paper investigated how the spatial, morphological and thermal characteristics of residential houses contribute to energy consumption predictions by utilising a state-of-the-art automated machine learning (autoML) tool for properties’ construction age bands and energy consumption prediction. A case study has been conducted with around 143,000 residential properties in Sheffield. The autoML model successfully estimated the energy consumption with a mean absolute percentage error of 18.1% and a R2 score of 0.828. Variables used were ranked by their permutation feature importance. Housing sizes and conditions of the external walls are found to be the most important features when estimating energy consumption of residential buildings in Sheffield. Relatively larger houses developed in neighbourhood with higher density may benefited the most from home upgrading projects for more significant energy consumption reduction.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">reports</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PIN</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_quantifying_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quantifying Agglomeration Productivity Potential in Long-Term Infrastructure Planning</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi, Jordan Pannell, Stephen Hincks, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NMUsstMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Giuliano Punzo</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> Oct 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://productivityinsightsnetwork.co.uk/app/uploads/2020/07/20200702-PIN-Small-Project-Report-Arbabi-et-al.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20Quantifying%20Agglomeration%20Productivity%20Potential%20i.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-pmid="" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">confs</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">EGU</abbr></div> <div id="wood_extreme_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Extreme Climate Change Impacts on Urban Infrastructure and Support Systems</div> <div class="author"> Tom Wood, Hadi Arbabi, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In EGU General Assembly 2023</em>, Apr 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15799" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Wood%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Extreme%20Climate%20Change%20Impacts%20on%20Urban%20Infrastruc.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15799"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15799" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this study we present synthesised evidence from the most extreme estimates of climate change effects such as extreme temperatures, precipitation, flooding, drought, wildfire, storms and sea-level rise from ECC scenarios, assessing the potential worst-case impacts on urban systems with a focus on heterogeneous regional impacts and the potential need for significant pre-emptive adaptation efforts.

Non-residential buildings are subject to the latter of these options more than dwellings due to higher rates of ownership changes. This study assesses the carbon emissions of each of the above options for a poorly-performing retail building in Sheffield, UK. The embodied carbon and operational performance of each scenario are calculated to identify the most sustainable option over a 50 year lifespan. The scenario with the lowest emissions is found to be a retrofit case study relying upon electricity as its sole fuel source. The new build scenarios emitted significantly more carbon over the building’s lifespan despite performing better operationally than the refurbishment scenario. It was also found that, due to the decarbonisation of the national grid, relying on gas boilers instead of electric fuel sources would make carbon emissions approximately 2.5x bigger in the refurbishment model, despite being legal under UK building regulations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IOP</abbr></div> <div id="sheng_deep_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Deep Multimodal Learning for Residential Building Energy Prediction</div> <div class="author"> Yulan Sheng, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SU1ik_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wil O.

Approximately 24 million existing dwellings in England made up over 32% of the overall energy consumption in 2020. A robust understanding of existing buildings’ energy performance is therefore critical in guiding proper home retrofit measures to accelerate towards meeting the UK’s climate targets. A substantial number of predictions at a city scale rely on available data, e.g., Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and GIS products, to develop statistical and machine learning models to estimate energy consumption. However, issues with existing data are not negligible. This work adopted the idea of deep multimodal learning to study the potential for using Google Street View (GSV) images as an additional input for residential building energy prediction. 20,031 GSV images of 5,933 residential buildings in central Barnsley, UK, have been selected for a case study. All images were pre-processed using a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to minimise the noise caused by other elements that may appear nearby. Building specifications that cannot be easily determined by the appearance are extracted from existing EPC information as text-based inputs for prediction. A multimodal model was designed to jointly take images and texts as inputs. These inputs are first propagated through a convolutional neural network and multi-layer perceptron, respectively, before being combined into a connected network for final energy prediction. The multi-input model was trained and tested on the case study area and predicted an annual energy consumption with a mean absolute difference of 0.01kWh/m2 per annum on average compared with what is recorded in the EPC. The difference between the predicted results and the EPC may also provide some hints on the bias the certificates potentially contain.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IOP</abbr></div> <div id="ward_measuring_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Measuring the Cityscape: A Pipeline from Street-Level Capture to Urban Quantification</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SU1ik_kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wil O.

Furthermore, with increasing populations and urbanisation, demand for these materials continues to increase, and in turn, so will the embodied environmental impacts created from the extraction, processing, transport and maintenance of these materials. Shorter building lifetimes are also becoming more prevalent, in part due to densification in urban areas. This creates both wasted materials and embodied impacts. A suggested greenhouse gas mitigation strategy is therefore to extend the lifetime of materials/components, e.g. through reuse, in order to displace the need for new materials and their associated impacts. However, this calls for a new way of thinking about the built environment, it becomes a system of stocks and flows, where the output flows should be redirected into inputs. However, this requires a much greater understanding of this system, which is in essence the material metabolism of the built environment. To date, research in this area has largely focused on single buildings, and techniques such as design for deconstruction and reuse that seek to improve the availability of reused materials, this could be thought of as a circular economic approach. However, for a true assessment of circular economic potential, a single building is not sufficient, as it provides a limited feedstock for future buildings. To capture the full extent of flow interactions, a wider system should be investigated-that of a neighbourhood/city-enabling better identification of the interdependencies that exist and potential synergies to be made between these flows, across multiple scales. This paper presents the background literature and an initial scoping exercise of such an assessment, focusing on a neighbourhood in Sheffield, England.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="arbabi_renewable_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Renewable Energy Technologies in Campus-Sized Developments: A Spatial Study</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi, Boris R Lazarov, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eA75iZIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Mayfield</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In CIBSE Technical Symposium</em>, Apr 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.cibse.org/Knowledge/CIBSE-Technical-Symposium-2015/Renewable-energy-technologies-in-campus-sized-deve" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20et%20al.%20-%202015%20-%20Renewable%20Energy%20Technologies%20in%20Campus-Sized%20Deve.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-pmid="" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Using hourly energy and water consumption data and theoretical models representing low-carbon and green energy production technologies, such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, combined heat and power, solar collectors, and seasonal thermal energy storage, an integrated node-based static model has been developed.

Also, the article concludes that alteration in the composition of the technologies used has significant spatial impact and implications on achieving carbon-neutral developments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">thesis</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">phd</abbr></div> <div id="arbabi_urban_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Urban Productivity &amp; Spatial Patterns Across Scales: A Multi-Scale Exploration of Urban Networks and Their Hierarchical Configurations</div> <div class="author"> Hadi Arbabi</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>University of Sheffield</em>, Apr 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/25054/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publications/Arbabi%20-%202019%20-%20Urban%20Productivity%20&amp;%20Spatial%20Patterns%20Across%20Scale.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-pmid="" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Understanding the nuances at play across different spatial scales is of crucial importance when considering urban economic-energetic size-cost performance, specifically when longer-term consequences are considered. Through the application of an allometric understanding of cities, a more nuanced narrative is offered highlighting the interplay of urban productivity and spatial configurations of human interactions across scales. This is presented in three parts. In the initial examination of the urban economic-energetic size-cost balance across spatial scales, we seek new insights on the effects of scale in relation to urban connectivity and density for maximizing urban size-cost balance. For this, we use the urban system in England and Wales as a topical testbed where agglomeration-based arguments have been used in support of better inter-city connectivity in order to address a historic North-South regional economic productivity divide. The inadequate connectivity thought to be affecting the economic performance across the urban network in England and Wales, however, is shown to permeate across spatial scales. More broadly, this points at a scale-induced hierarchy of urban connectivity concerning potential improvements needed at inter- and intra-city scales. This is followed by an examination of the universality and transferability of scaling insights, and their nuances, between different cities and systems of cities. Considering the current transport schemes designed to address the North-South economic gap, we examine the continental comparisons drawn specifically from the inter-city transport infrastructure connecting the Randstad in the Netherlands and Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in Germany. Our examination points towards fundamental differences that exist in the structure and distribution of population density across the countries and their city-regions across various scales. Additionally, the cross comparison demonstrates that, although scaling insights are transferable between urban systems, a simple multi-scale assessment of individual systems of cities in isolation is sufficient when investigating urban connectivity from an urban allometric point of view. Finally, returning full circle to the effects of spatial scales and distance on the geographical patterns of urban connectivity, we review a mathematically grounded approach to sort and organize the intra- and inter-city connectivity hierarchy while matching complementary infrastructural needs based on size-cost balances for a number of different scenarios. Together, this narrative provides a somewhat enhanced and most crucially spatially multi-scale examination of the arguments regarding connectivity and agglomeration in an urban context.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0" style="text-transform: lowercase"> © copyright 2023 hadi e arbabi. artisanally crafted with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">jekyll</a> based on <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">al-folio</a> theme. hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">github pages</a>. last retouched on November 03, 2023. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?7b30caa5023af4af8408a472dc4e1ebb"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.22.1/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?d633890033921b33e0ceb13d22340a9c"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?acdb9690d7641b2f8d40529018c71a01"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c9d9dd48933de3831b3ee5ec9c209cac" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script async src="https://rum.cronitor.io/script.js"></script> <script>window.cronitor=window.cronitor||function(){(window.cronitor.q=window.cronitor.q||[]).push(arguments)},cronitor("config",{clientKey:"24759c5c1d6c4595285a69f52e02dd24"});</script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
