to pass <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law">legislation</a> to target net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. however, the country is projected to just meet its fourth and fifth <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/uk/">carbon reduction targets</a> due largely to the interruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. recent efforts within the green industrial revolution, while well intended, have failed to deliver the scale and pace of change that is required to meet uk carbon budgets, and deliver the uk’s contribution to the paris agreement of limiting global warming to 1.5°c. however, buildings, especially the domestic stock, represent a significant opportunity to catapult the uk’s progress towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions.</p> <p>if the committee on climate changes’ carbon budgets are ratioed down to the domestic housing sector, this sets a budget of approximately 927mtco<sub>2e</sub> for england for the period to 2050. this is equivalent to the emissions from roughly 3.5m houses over the same period. unfortunately, we have over 22m houses currently contributing to national emissions, and that is not counting all the new homes being built to outdated standards on an annual basis!</p> <p>at the current rate of emissions, england’s homes will have produced around 2,250mtco<sub>2e</sub> by 2050 in the absence of carbon capture and storage (ccs) technologies. this means we have 12 years of a business as usual approach before the budget is blown. moreover, current approaches to calculating emissions often fail to take into account the whole life cycle emissions of buildings and infrastructure. for example, in the recently published <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/sixth-carbon-budget/">sixth carbon budget</a> lifecycle emissions are only discussed for fuels. there is often little consideration of the emissions associated with the manufacturing, processing, construction, maintenance and disposal of materials needed for net zero interventions. ignoring these critical elements of the lifecycle simply means that we are not counting our true carbon footprint and risk shifting the carbon burden from one system to another, resulting in the uk failing to deliver net zero by 2050.</p> <h2 id="retrofit-is-key">retrofit is key</h2> <p>retrofitting the uk’s existing domestic building stock to improve performance and comfort, and reduce emissions, will play a fundamental role in achieving net zero. to get a sense of the intensity of the retrofit activities that are needed to achieve this decarbonisation goal, we need to look at the embodied and operational emissions for buildings for the 2020-2050 period under a battery of different retrofit measures.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset"

of ccs deployment, total emissions consistently overshoot the 2050 carbon budget in all scenarios, with the exception of those where we aggressively deploy heat pumps and electrify heating. given the implicit assumption that all these retrofit measures have already been implemented, urgent action is clearly required.</p> <p>specifically for domestic buildings, the following are becoming increasingly more essential:</p> <ul> <li><strong>targets are needed for a fabric first approach to retrofit homes.</strong> a fabric first approach will improve thermal efficiency and reduce heating demand sufficiently for heat pumps to deliver comfortable internal temperatures.</li> <li><strong>heat pump deployment needs to be ramped up now and cannot be delayed until 2028.</strong> there are nearly 20 million homes in england alone currently eligible for heat-pumps, installing 600,000 heat pumps per year means an additional 25 years will be required after 2028 before every home has one.</li> <li><strong>zero carbon legislation for new buildings.</strong> every new building constructed that is not zero carbon in operation is another building that will need to be retrofitted before 2050.</li> <li><strong>network ambition.</strong> current targets for offshore wind are insufficient to power every home without deep retrofit to reduce domestic energy demand. on-going work at the university of sheffield in collaboration with creds at ucl estimates that meeting a more stringent <a href="https://carbonbudget.manchester.ac.uk/reports/">tyndall centre carbon budget</a> for the domestic sector would require deployment of at least 30 thousand 2mw wind turbines in the next year in tandem with the nationwide installation of heat-pumps and double glazing under the national grid’s <a href="http://nationalgrieso.com/future-energy/future-energy-scenarios/fes-2020-documents">steady progression scenario</a> of decarbonisation of the grid.</li> </ul> <p>this rant was developed closely with danielle densley tingley and xinyi li from university of sheffield, and tadj oreszczyn and george bennett from ucl. an earlier version of it is available on abc research program

land-use interventions for better urban economic performance are often of limited capacity in providing long-term ‘place-based’ blueprints.[^1] best <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldeconaf/134/134.pdf">framed</a> by sir david higgins, the former chair of hs2 limited, what we need is an overall national transport strategy for and against which individual interventions can be constructed and appraised. in our productivity insights network project, we attempted to quantifying a sense of productivity premium that may be locked in and associated with the spatial organization and connectivity of small-area neighborhoods and their demographic profiles within cities.</p> <h2 id="cities-as-geographic-networks">cities as geographic networks</h2> <p>emerging <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6139/1438">studies</a> on patterns of urban scaling across systems of cities have sought to formalize and explain long-observed size-related agglomerations in and across different countries by developing explicit and implicit geographically embedded network models of cities’ inhabitants and mobility infrastructure. these works make explicit the assumption within the agglomeration-related work that average-aggregated urban economic output is a function of the number of human interactions fostered and facilitated by cities. within these spatially explicit frameworks, long-term blueprints of infrastructure can then be thought of in terms of spatial layouts of the cities’ inhabitants that increase or maximize the number of interactions between individuals across the city and hence its economic output. particularly, if given a certain labor and skills profile, the relative number of interactions between a city as is it exists in space and how it could potentially be (re)arranged provides a gage for the magnitude of potential productivity premium related to the city’s spatial organization.</p> <h2 id="what-we-have-seen-so-far">what we have seen so far</h2> <p>in the rest of this post, i briefly summarize our main observations based on our optimization of inter-neighborhood distances in sheffield to maximize its inhabitants’ interactions. i should mention in advance that our findings are mostly intuitive in themselves and might appear trivial. what is of importance, however, is that they are independently reaffirmed by our approach which can be seen to be more general in its assumptions especially avoiding strong ones regarding individual behavior.</p> <h3 id="denser-cities-perform-better-especially-if-long-range-connectivity-is-more-difficult">denser cities perform better especially if long-range connectivity is more difficult</h3> <p>this one is too obvious. it is easy to see that a trivial solution to optimizing inter-neighborhood distances, for maximizing individual interactions for a geographically embedded social network on a flat plane, is to stack individuals vertically to maximize density and interactions!</p> <p>we have estimated sheffield’s potential productivity premiums as the number of inhabitants’ interactions, under a varying influence of distance on interactions, relative to those of the city’s existing geography. when we assume a mobility infrastructure that assists in formation of long-range interactions already exists, there is virtually no difference in productivity of an optimized layout and only about a 12% advantage for an extremely densified layout. however, as long-range interaction formation becomes more difficult, ie, we assume a more realistic provision of mobility anywhere outside london, rearrangements of the city’s neighborhood layout can unlock a 15% increase in output with extreme densification signaling a near sevenfold increase in output.</p> <h3 id="homogenous-deployment-of-mixed-used-planning-across-the-city-is-beneficial">homogenous deployment of mixed-used planning across the city is beneficial</h3> <p>for most cities, the neighborhoods with the largest number of inter-neighborhood interactions comprise the city center and often exist within the city’s ring road. city centers, therefore, house a high-density mix of residential use, commercial activities, and crucially employment. this combined effect of their density and mixed use transforms them to the foci of both inter- and intra-neighborhood interactions. meanwhile, the further away one gets from the city center, the more the prominence of suburban commuter-belt residential use and fewer the opportunities for local interactions.</p> <p>delving into the inter-neighborhood distances after optimization shows that increasing the number of interactions in the city requires a change in the land use. in essence, city-center type activities need to be more easily accessible city-wide. as such, the long-term optimal spatial layout of cities can be seen as one more resembling a chess board pattern of residential/commercial use that both maximizes overall city-wide interactions and <a

these effects may be due to the particularly segregated organization of neighborhoods in sheffield, the core reasoning remains the same as that underlying the need for mixed-use planning. lower-income lower-education neighborhoods are inherently more likely to be vulnerable to effects of low long-range accessibility while simultaneously less likely to feature adequate employment opportunities. the break-up of core city-center type functionality to be more evenly distributed across the city cultivates more interactions in these neighborhoods.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3

id="connectivity-beyond-physical-mobility">connectivity beyond physical mobility</h2> <p>as a final note, we should perhaps mention that interpretations of urban scaling models of cities need not be constrained to purely physical aspects of mobility. our approach has been motivated by and particularly focused on the physical aspect of the spatial organization of cities and the provision of mobility within them and we have, simplistically, quantified interactions and the possibility of their existence over distances in a city. with particular reference to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the prevalence of home-working has forced a <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-06-27_GB_Mobility_Report_en-GB.pdf">dramatic drop in physical intra-city mobility</a>. however, for those sectors that have remained economically active despite lockdown measures, the underlying individual interactions involved in creating cities’ output have not completely vanished. portions of these interactions are now simply forced to be made remotely. the spatial patterns of interaction that we have identified, ostensibly based on road distances between neighborhoods, can, therefore, be interpreted as priorities for provision of alternative and/or digital connectivity infrastructure.</p> <p>an earlier version of this post is available on productivity insights network’s <a

has recently announced a £300,000 study that is to look at the improvements to the road links ostensibly linking preston and leeds travel-to-work areas (ttwa). the study as the transport secretary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-trans-pennine-roads-study-announced">chris grayling</a> has put it</p> <blockquote> <p>… is part of our ongoing work to ensure the routes between lancashire and yorkshire are fit for the future – helping link communities better and boosting the economy to supercharge the northern powerhouse.</p> </blockquote> <p>the announcement does make references to the importance of the east lancashire-yorkshire corridor to the freight traffic of the industries there. and, before any further grumblings, we should clarify that any and all improvements to transport infrastructure are perhaps beneficial. eventually.</p> <p>that being said, as with the original plans for the northern powerhouse, the choice of cities and regions to be connected, be it via road or rail, comes across as arbitrary and the growth- and <a href="https://transportforthenorth.com/wp-content/uploads/A-report-on-the-Northern-Transport-Strategy-1.pdf">agglomeration-related language</a> raises a few questions. put simply, we believe <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/02/10/a-tale-of-many-cities">bigger cities to be more efficient</a> with their resources and productive economically. this boils down to the ability of cities to facilitate and maximize interactions between people ‘boosting the economy’ such that the per capita output of the city increases with population. this is mainly why the efforts aimed at addressing the economic performance gap between the north and the southeast have focused on connecting major northern urban centers as far as transport strategy is concerned. these inter-city transport links are seen as a way of constructing a virtual city in the north that has the size of london and hence its productivity and efficiency.</p> <h2 id="agglomeration-based-infrastructure-intervention">agglomeration-based infrastructure intervention</h2> <p>when it comes to the magic powers of urban agglomeration, however, there is fine print involved. from a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130620142925.htm">theoretical perspective</a>, for cities belonging to a given urban system – say that of the uk – we would expect to see a balance between the cities’ economic output and what they pay in terms of the costs of moving people about in the city to enable those economic returns – a size-cost balance if you will. as a function of the cities’ density and productivity, this size-cost balance would look something like this.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture>

<p><br/></p> <p>we would then expect our cities to have evolved over time – think decades – so that they are, more or less, scattered over the y-w curve around that point of optimum η. what is more interesting is the type of infrastructural/planning intervention a city would need to get closer to the optimum η, if they happen to be a long way to either side of it. for those that are located to the left of the optimum η, they suffer from insufficient interactions. these are cities that are not meeting their potential because their population do not enjoy adequate internal mobility. climbing the hill to the left would then require providing such cities with better intra-city transit systems.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source

and in need of better internal mobility and accessibility. however, if we really insisted on going ahead with inter- rather than intra-city solutions, what the agglomeration-based inter-city transport arguments address is the complementarity that exists between the needs of cities that are not realizing their potentials to the left of the hill and their counterparts on the other side of the curve. if two of such units happened to be in one another’s neighborhood, then an adjustment of urban boundaries and provision of comparable transport between the two cities would help conjure a metropolitan area that potentially performs better than the two initial units.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset"

connect in the north, we can now make this implicit reasoning in the existing agglomeration arguments explicit and look at all the city pair combinations possible and pick the pair that delivers the closest performance to the optimum η. this is exactly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17421772.2019.1569762">what we have done</a> for all cities in england and wales defined at various spatial scales and over various neighborhood distances. so, how do our synthetic city regions look when mapped?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source

<p><br/></p> <p>both of the above maps highlight the top 1% most frequent pairings when aggregating various distances and definitions of cities onto the 2011 ttwas. a keen observer would notice that of these highly frequent pairings, regardless of the overall method, quite a few show pairings of a city with itself – most prominently that of london but also those of manchester, leicester, exeter, and chelmsford. these effectively note that there are city units that have the potential to be linked while being situated in the same overall travel-to-work area. what we need to note right afterwards is that none of these ttwas have an intra-city transport infrastructure comparable to the one overseen by the transport for london that does in fact provide the type of connectivity the framework is suggesting.</p> <p>the other important take away from these maps is the observation that many cities – take sheffield as a case in point – tend not to form recurring links with any one place. what is being highlighted in such cases is that many cities across the country have infrastructure needs that are very much unique to themselves. these places wont readily lend themselves to inter-city region-building schemes as their infrastructural need, be it better internal mobility or increased density, is not complemented by any of their neighbors.</p> <p>finally, let us introduce a crucial constraint and focus on the preston-bradford area for brevity. instead of aggregating at all distances looking at all possibilities, we can choose our pairings preferring closer pairs over those further apart unless there are no suitable pairs available locally. this allows us to gradually grow regions outward and build on existing proximities. the top 5% most frequent of these pairings

bradford – note that it is only under the purely agglomerative approach and without our geographic constraint that we see a link between preston and bradford. this brings us back to the often arbitrary choice of regions to connect when considering transport projects to boost the economy.</p> <h2 id="caveats-or-why-we-could-still-do-with-a-trans-pennine-study-anyway">caveats or why we could still do with a trans-pennine study anyway</h2> <p>the approach we have reviewed does in fact let us identify the infrastructural needs of city units across spatial scales. it does also provide a systematic way of identifying potential intra- and inter-city transport links. what it does not do, however, is providing a cost-benefit assessment that would gauge the of cost realistically implementing such transport connections versus the real-terms economic benefits they might provide. the issue to reiterate at the end is perhaps that any and all improvements to transport infrastructure are perhaps beneficial, eventually. it just may be a good idea to start appraising these projects in a more structured and coherent way.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="infrastrcuture"/><category term="systems"/><category term="productivity"/><category term="agglomeration"/><category

england and wales <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2018.1490501">show a systemic lack of adequate mobility and accessibility</a> at various spatial scales. this lack of adequate mobility provisions is at the heart of a less-than-expected economic performance. while such effects are more easily noticeable at larger inter-city scales, the problem is reoccurring at smaller scales and intra-city boundaries. this suggests that although intra-city transport-led agglomeration strategies are fitting, when implemented alone they would only mask mobility shortcomings at smaller scales without addressing the underlying causes of under-performance.</p> <h2 id="so-which-ones-do-you-think-have-an-intra-city-transport-problem">so which ones do you think have an intra-city transport
